## v4.0.0 (2023-01-02)

## v3.0.0 (2021-07-19)
This update is a rewrite of Downline in Tauri. This gets the filesize down to 5 MB.

It should mostly have the same options as the previous versions, however one or two features are missing. 

If you want to lend a helping hand with development, I'd super appreciate it!
