# Downline

![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/stefnotch/downline/total.svg)

[Downline](https://stefnotch.github.io/downline/) is a free, cross-platform desktop application for downloading video and audio from YouTube and many other sites. It is a frontend for youtube-dl. Works on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

[Check out the other youtube-dl GUIs here](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedl/wiki/info-guis), I personally quite recommend [this one](https://github.com/jely2002/youtube-dl-gui)

**Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/stefnotch/downline/releases/latest)**.

**Project on ice:**
Yt-dlp is a commandline Python program, and as such, has a horrible developer experience in terms of embedding. This won't change in the forseeable future.
