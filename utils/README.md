# Utils for developers

Uses Deno

- Does not use Rust, since Rust projects take up too much space, and take too long to compile to provide a nice developer experience for one-off utilities.
- Does not use Node.js, because Typescript support and reasonable filepath handling is very nice to have.

See root README for the documentation.
